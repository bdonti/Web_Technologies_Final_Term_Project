Abstractâ€” Traffic management system is considered as one of the
major dimensions of a smart city. With the rapid growth of
population and urban mobility in metropolitan cities, traffic
congestion is often seen on roads. To tackle various issues for
managing traffic on roads and to help authorities in proper
planning, a smart traffic management system using the Internet of
Things (IoT) is proposed in this paper. A hybrid approach
(combination of centralized and decentralized) is used to optimize
traffic flow on roads and an algorithm is devised to manage
various traffic situations efficiently. For this purpose, the system
takes traffic density as input from a) cameras b) and sensors, then
manages traffic signals. Another algorithm based on Artificial
Intelligence is used to predict the traffic density for future to
minimize the traffic congestion. Besides this, RFIDs are also used
to prioritize the emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire
brigade vehicles during a traffic jam. In case of fire on the road,
Smoke sensors are also part of this system to detect this situation.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed traffic
management system, a prototype is developed which not only
optimizes the flow of traffic but also connects nearby rescue
departments with a centralized server. Moreover, it also extracts
useful information presented in graphical formats that may help
the authorities in future road planning.
